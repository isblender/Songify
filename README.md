# Image-to-Song App

This is the backend server for the **Image-to-Song** iOS app, which allows users to take a picture, apply an algorithm on it, and get a song that resembles the image. The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express**, and it uses **Firebase** for user data management and storage of image history and song recommendations.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Receives image data from the iOS app for processing to generate song recommendations.
- **Song Recommendation**: Uses an algorithm to analyze the image and recommend a song that reflects the visual qualities of the image.
- **User Management**: Supports user data storage via MongoDB, including user authentication and personalized history of images and song responses.
- **Image and Song History**: Stores each userâ€™s image-to-song history for easy retrieval and future reference.

## Tech Stack
- **Swift**: For creating an aesthetic frontend.
- **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.io**: For building the backend server.
- **MongoDB**: Manages user data, stores images and song history, and handles authentication.
